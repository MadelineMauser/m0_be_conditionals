# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
- I feel confident in my ability to use them.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
- I feel confident in my understanding of these operators as well.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
- I feel fairly confident but I could probably practice more for fluency.

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
- I spent several hours, which is about 50-70% longer than I expected. I got more distracted than I anticipated.

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
- I could do with more practice using the operators and if statements together. I can practice in my own time, and it shouldn't affect my calendar much.

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
- I don't have questions at the moment, but I will consult google and my teammate for help if needed.
